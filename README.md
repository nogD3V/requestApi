### A SIMPLE WAY TO CONSUME DATA FROM AN AP WITH PYTHON.

Technology used:

Language:
  - PYTHON
  
 Libraries:
  - STREAMLIT
  - REQUESTS
  - BOOTSTRAP

**In this app we used PYTHON with the framework REQUESTS to request data from github's API and STREAMLIT to create an interface that was stylized with BOOTSTRAP and CSS .**
